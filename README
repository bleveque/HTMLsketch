# HTMLsketch
This is a drawing tool I created for LADS, a project I was working on. LADS is a artwork gallery built completely on HTML/JavaScript which allows people to easily zoom in/out large artworks. I needed to create a drawing tool to allow curators to annotate the artworks but at the same time zoom in without losing quality. And therefore, a vector-graphics paint application was born!

## Features
 - Uses RaphaÃ«l SVG libraries to draw the objects
 - Uses JQuery libraries to makes things easier
 - Can do rudimetnary 'layers' and shapes drawn can be moved around
 - Eraser tool allowing paths to be erased ala mspaint  (this tool was only added to Adobe Illustrator in CS3!)
 - Should support all modern browsers

## Todo
 - Allow resizing of shapes
 - Better layer manipulation
